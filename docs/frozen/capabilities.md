# Frozen capabilities (Freeze review A, P-PR_34)

Review of the merged capability registry at the F11 freeze. `packages/contracts/tests/frozen-capabilities.test.ts` checks the rules in this file and the snapshots it describes. A deliberate change to the registry updates this file in the same commit, signed by the lead.

## Frozen values

The contract of every capability is frozen in `docs/frozen/snapshots/<manifest>.json`: one small file per manifest, one line per capability (`name@version`) holding the sha256 of its canonical definition with shared schemas resolved (`lib/snapshot.ts`). The regen bot writes the files with `node tools/gen/src/cli.ts --snapshots`; the test fails on a missing, changed or stray file and names the capability. There is no registry-wide hash, count or per-lane table here on purpose: each of those changed with every contract change, so every contract PR conflicted with every other. Two PRs that change different manifests now merge in either order with nothing to re-record.

## Completeness (all capabilities, checked by the test)

- Every capability has an input schema, an output schema, at least one example, at least one declared error, an effects value (read, write or outward) and a level.
- Permission is a catalogue key or null (grant-only); both are valid, null means the grant level alone decides.
- Every outward capability has a gate; 47 of them use `gate.act = none` and each of those carries a written reason.
- Every capability with idempotency `key` has an `idempotencyKey` in its input (through `$ref` where the schema is shared).
- Every capability has exactly one example, so no capability is unexemplified.

## Sample read at the freeze

At the F11 freeze the lead read 10 percent of each lane's capabilities (sorted by name, every n-th). The findings below come from that read. The sample lists are not kept: they went stale with the first contract change and the completeness rules above are what the test enforces.

## Findings from reading the sample

Nothing blocks the freeze. The sample read cleanly: summaries match the declared effects, outward capabilities carry gates that match their risk (send, post, pay, delete, push_protected), and error lists are non-empty with permission codes on guarded calls. Points for the owning lane to confirm before its first build packet, none of which change a count or the hash:

- L7a writes with level `view` and no permission (`devices.revoke`, `spaces.leave`, `stars.toggle`, `identity.totp_begin`, `identity.passkey_remove`) act on the caller's own objects. Confirm the resource binding resolves to the caller, so the grant check cannot be satisfied by another person's object.
- `access.requests.decline` has no permission and level `view`. Confirm the handler requires the request's approver, since the registry alone does not.
- `governance.tombstones.reapply` is described as a system call and has no permission. Confirm its caller restriction or keep it out of the HTTP and MCP surfaces.
- `runs.undo` has risk `high` and no gate. Undo replays inverse writes, so confirm it never reverses an outward effect (the preview capability `runs.preview_undo` says what it cannot undo).
- 39 capabilities carry a gate while their effects are `write`, for example `mail.domain.remove` and `network.server_remove` (gate `delete`). This is intended: the gate applies to destructive inward writes too.



## 12 Nov 2026: threads.remove_agent is audited always (lane f-revoke)

`threads.remove_agent@1` now has `audit: 'always'`, as `threads.outside_agent.remove` has. Nothing else in its contract changed: same input, output, level, permission, events and errors. Why: since the f-revoke round, taking an agent out of a chat also takes back, as the host, every grant that chat gave it, whoever gave it; the Console's audit log must show who took that access away, as it already does for an outside agent. Snapshot: docs/frozen/snapshots/chat.json, regenerated with `node tools/gen/src/cli.ts --snapshots`.

## 12 Nov 2026: Vault keys go only to approved hosts (lane f-auto)

- 12 Nov 2026, lane f-auto: `automations.try_read` is now held (gate `send`, when `automations.key_host_unapproved(input)`, risk medium, error `permission.needs_approval`): an agent's test read that would send a Vault key to a host nobody approved for that item waits for a person (Allow, Always allow, Deny). New `automations.key_hosts.list`, `automations.key_hosts.allow` and `automations.key_hosts.remove`: the hosts approved per Vault item (table `automations_key_hosts`, migration 0013). Signed: lead, 12 Nov 2026.
- 12 Nov 2026, lane f-auto, second look: `automations.key_hosts.pending` and `automations.key_hosts.pending_bind` (what a held read or binding would send, read by the server for the card); `connections.create` and `connections.set_secret` are held (gate `send`, when `automations.bind_hosts_unapproved(input)`, error `permission.needs_approval`) when an agent binds a key to hosts not approved for it. `automations.vault_usage` gains an optional `hidden` count. Signed: lead, 12 Nov 2026.
